This is a private repository for personal practice and coursework as part of my MSc in Data Science.

## 📌 Purpose

- Store and organize my Jupyter notebooks
- Practice working with Git and GitHub
- Develop good habits for project versioning and reproducibility

## 📁 Structure

- `notebooks/` — coursework notebooks and experiments
- `data/` — local datasets (not tracked in Git)
- `.gitignore` — ensures data and temporary files are excluded

## 🔒 Access

This repository is private and intended for personal use.  
Instructors or reviewers may be given access upon request.

Expect a mix of clean work and messy experimentation 😊
